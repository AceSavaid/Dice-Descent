## Post Jam Notes 
Using the feedback from the game jam and balancing it with the feel that the game had, I made a post jam update to the game.   
The following is what has been updated  

    The health of players and enemies have been drastically cut to make the game more intense  
    The system for calculating damage has been completely changed to better suit this.  Instead of multiplying the attack and then dividing by the defence, they are added and subtracted from the roll.  
    Healing items are weaker to match the decrease in player health as well as to give more challenge.  
    Skills are now successful if the roll lands on the number or above  
    Each class in the game has one of 4 certain skill types  
        True Damage skills deal a specified amount of damage when successful, ignoring enemy defense  
        Halving Health skills deals half an enemy's current health in damage, very useful at the beginning of battle  
        Health Steal skill heals the player the amount of damage dealt to the enemy when successful  
        Healing skill heals the player a major amount of health when successful  
    More information is shown about the player class at the beginning to explain more of their skill  
    Some bug fixing  
        Slight UI changes and some timing changes  

Some aspects of it still needs some work,  but hopefully this update will improve the fun of it.    Any feedback is gladly welcomed.  

The jam version is still available on the game page for anyone who wishes to revisit it.
